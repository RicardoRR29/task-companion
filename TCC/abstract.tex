The TACO (Task Companion) system is a web application that manages interactive workflows without relying on external servers. Developed with React and TypeScript, it allows organizations to create sequences of steps—text, questions, media or custom components—and store them locally using IndexedDB. The project adopted an iterative methodology, collecting requirements from real onboarding scenarios and progressively expanding features such as analytics and integration via webhooks. Usability tests demonstrated that the editor is intuitive and that the offline mode enables training in environments with limited connectivity. Performance evaluations showed response times under 200 milliseconds for most operations. The results confirm that TACO streamlines documentation and training processes while offering flexibility for future enhancements such as cloud synchronization and advanced metrics.
